PHP iSDK for Laravel 4
==================
This is a port of [Infusionsoft's PHP SDK](https://github.com/infusionsoft/PHP-iSDK) to Laravel 4 inspired by a [similar project](https://github.com/tshafer/Infusionsoft-for-Laravel-4/tree/master/src/Chrono/Infusionsoft) created by [tshafer](https://github.com/tshafer).

Motivation
==================
Infusionsoft's API is business critical and being a control freak I wanted to take ownership over merging in future updates. I'll also be writing a db based logging system to track execution time on a per API call basis.

Install Instructions
==================
Coming soon.
